# hello-world

Learning GitHub to be able to contribute to the greater community.

Primarily interested in PowerShell, PowerCLI, VMware and Python projects

Have done some work with web-scrapers, file automation for backups and cleanup, and a little data science with R

Mostly have no idea what I'm doing.  this is fun!
